# Moonshot

A beautiful cross-platform flashing tool.

## Why?

- Community frustration with existing flashing tools.
- We have unique ideas that we want to implement in the future, ex: selecting distro images from within the app.
- For fun.

## Development

Install [Wails](https://wails.io), then run `wails dev` to start a development server with hot-reloading.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

## "Moonshot"?

See the Suisei song with the same title.
